![My profile picture](/assets/profile.png){:style="float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom: 15px"} Hey, Allan Vital here, owner and guilty of this site. Here I usually talk about software development in general, management, and the human side of tech work. I don't have a regular post schedule, but I try to keep my content relevant when written.

I graduated in Computer Science from [Centro Universit√°rio SENAC](https://www.sp.senac.br/) in 2010, and have been solving problems since.

You can find my [Linkedin here (which counts as my resume)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanvital/).  If you think I can help you with some cool project, don't hesitate to contact me at [allan.vital@gmail.com](mailto:allan.vital@gmail.com) or [@allanvital](https://twitter.com/allanvital) .
