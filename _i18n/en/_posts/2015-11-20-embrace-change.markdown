In recent past, Orkut was the main social network in my area. Everybody used it, and everybody loved it. I believe it was the first "real" social network that was massively popular here and there were no signs that it would be replaced by Facebook.

When launched, the first iPhone revolutionized the industry of smartphones. It was something new and everybody loved it and bought one. Today Android has a bigger market share ([talking about number of devices](http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/smartphone-os-market-share/)).

And even although Windows was the first in, the [majority of online servers today are Linux-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Public_servers_on_the_Internet).

The idea behind these facts is that even first comers can get behind in the long run. And there are, of course, a lot of reasons for this to happen, but one that always pops out is the easiness to change.

The only certain in business and technology is that things change. If you are not prepared for it, you will be behind the top competition. I believe that this is the main reason why agile methods work: they embrace the idea that planned things change and that customer needs also change.

With this in mind, maybe the biggest advice to software companies should be: always be ready to change your planned roadmap.
