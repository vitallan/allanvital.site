There sure is a lot of talk about company culture these days. 

## the foundation: higienical

respect - transparency - phychological safety

## the structure: individual interactions into foundation and company

you incentive the worst behaviour that you allows, but beware of cutting "rough" interactions for fear of conflict

your company natural culture will influence your internal team culture

## the final design: individual views + guidance over structure

the structure done, now you can focus individual views to grow and acomodate different behaviours. A highly competitive individual will need some kind of challenge to be fullfiled, so a team with someone like this will need to create space and opportunity for it to occur.



### individual behaviours vs wanted culture

### the road to continuous improvement
